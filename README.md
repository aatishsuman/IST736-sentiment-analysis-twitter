# Sentiment Analysis of Twitter data - a comaprison study

Perform sentiment analysis on the sentiment140 dataset and compare the performance of the traditional machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest and Logsitic Regression with Deep Learning models like LSTM and BERT. <br>

<b>The best results (test accuracies) of the deep learning models</b> â€“

Neural Network with TF-IDF -	81.17<br>
LSTM with Keras Embedding layer -	82.62<br>
LSTM with Word2Vec pretrained weights (untuned) -	83.61<br>
LSTM with Word2Vec pretrained weights (tuned)	- 83.53<br>
LSTM with GloVe pretrained weights (untuned)	- 84.01<br>
LSTM with GloVe pretrained weights (tuned)	- 83.99<br>
Neural Network with BERT pretrained model (untuned)	- 76.28<br>
LSTM with BERT pretrained model (untuned)	- 83.39<br>

The results from the traditional models are mentioned in the document.
